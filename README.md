# BlackjackProject

## Description:

This project is a simple implementation of a console-based Blackjack card game using Java. The game includes a deck of cards, hands for both the dealer and player, and follows basic Blackjack rules. The program allows players to Hit or Stand, and the dealer follows the "rule of 17" in making decisions.

## Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Java
Version Control: Git
IDE: Eclipse

## Lessons Learned:

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Designing classes to model entities (Deck, Card, Hand, Player) and utilizing OOP principles.
**Algorithmic Logic:** Implementing game logic, including shuffling, dealing cards, and decision-making based on rules like "rule of 17" for the dealer).
**User Input Handling:** Managing user input for actions like Hit or Stand during the game.
Console-based Interaction: Creating a simple console interface for the game.

## How to Use

**Follow On-Screen Instructions:**
The game will prompt you to Hit or Stand during your turn.
Follow the prompts until the game concludes.
Winning a Round:
The winner of each round is determined based on who is closest to 21 without going over.
Note on Aces:
For this basic implementation, Aces are assumed to be 11.
